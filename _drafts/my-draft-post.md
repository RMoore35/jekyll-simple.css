This is a post I've been meaning to write for some time. As I stumbled through this last week and had both good and bad interactions, both online and in real life, I figured this was the right time. I also, against my own rules, been reading a bit of online banter.

Well, the title pretty much tells you where I am going with this.

Civility.

That's a word we probably don't use near as often as we should. And that's troubling. Where did it go? Were we ever civil?

I'm not sure we were. At the very least, the argument can be made that there were always people that were nasty to each other. There is some truth to that.

I also want to mention people aren't nice in general. Remember when we used to have duels over disagreements??

But I don't think anyone will deny that the way we tend to engage online is drastically different than we would engage in-person. On its face, that's OK. And really, there should be some difference because at its core, it's just a different venue. You would engage with someone different at the store than you would at a political rally.

Recently I was going about updating my <a href="https://moore-films.netlify.app/">film-reviews site</a> and there were a lot of changes I needed to make. One of them was understanding spacing and how to best achieve it in what is often a mobile-first world.

One the first iteration of my blog, with maybe one exception, I was using pixels to space everything and size my text.
