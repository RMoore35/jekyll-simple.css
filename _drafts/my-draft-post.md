This is day 8 of my 30 days of the carnivore diet. You can start from the beginning [here](https://blog.mooreanalysis.com/carnivore/).

## Update - Day 8

Was able to complete a 54 mile bike ride today! Had pretty good energy throughout, but was really drained as I neared the end. I don't think this was diet related, just the fact that I haven't done that distance in a while.

Otherwise, carnivore diet is going great!

Cheers!
