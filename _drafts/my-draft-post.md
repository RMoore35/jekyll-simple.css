I wanted to share a quick little something after months of manually adjusting the clock each time I shifted from windows to linux.

I don't know if this is a windows specific problem, or due to my laptop model (which I don't even know lol), or the linux distro I use (mint), or because I am dual-booting, or if I'm just a moron (likely). But, whenever I want the accurate time, I have to adjust it in the settings, only to have the clock show the wrong time when I switch to the other partition.

This is only a slight annoyance as I'm used to keeping track of several time zones and also military time. Regardless, it's nice to just look at the time and know that it is the real time!

So, I fired up a search engine and quickly was able to find a solution. It turns out that there is a very simple change you can make that solves the issue.

INSERT LINK AND DESCRIPTION ON HOW TO DO IT.
