This is a post that has probably been floating around in my head for some time. I have always been suspicious of the endless economic growth model for various reasons and for over a year now, I have been seriously concerned about internet privacy.

At the same time, I studied business administration and got to sit through endless lectures about why a company needs to pay a PR/design firm [$211,000,000](https://www.canny-creative.com/rebranding-failures-how-much-they-cost/) to re-design and roll-out their logo to further their quest for world domination.

Published in 1972, [The Limits to Growth](https://psmag.com/magazine/fallacy-of-endless-growth) was a treatise presented by researchers at MIT that was accepted with about as much praise as Jimmy Carter's [Malaise Speech](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/10/jimmy-carter-energy-crisis-malaise-speech-biden-supply-chain.html).

To be fair to President Carter, it actually looks like immediately after the speech, the reaction wasn't that terrible. But when gas prices and inflation kicked in soon thereafter, telling people to stop endless consumerism didn't pan out very well.

Now, I'm an American - I don't try to hide that. Frankly, I'm appalled nearly every day with our collective insatiable appetite for things. I'm guilty to as I've certainly made my fair share of needless purchases. And for fear of putting myself on a pedestal, I'm constantly having to correct. But so many people I talk to don't even see this as an issue. It would only be shocking if it didn't have such dire implications. Instead, it's frightening.

But, how does all of this relate to internet privacy?

Well, also when I was studying business administration, specifically taking several courses in data science and marketing, I started to see the numbers on the type of response rates and ROIs that were possible with targeted advertising. More pointedly, targeted advertising that involves collecting gigabytes or maybe even one day soon, terabytes, of data and then letting a computer decide what you are going to do next.

Why would a company spend a bunch of money on marketing and get a 20% ROI when they could instead pay Facebook or Google a little extra money and get a 60-100% ROI (or even higher)?

They wouldn't.

And therein lies the connection to internet privacy.
