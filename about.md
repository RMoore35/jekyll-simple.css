I like to be active. I love any excuse to stop what I'm doing and go outside.

I enjoy any form of exercise (mainly cycling, lifting, and running), reading, and classic films.

I love good coffee with good friends.

I am a growing privacy and open source advocate and I look forward to exploring
this more in the future.

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to head over to my [contact page](https://blog.mooreanalysis.com/contact/) and I'll get back with you as soon as I can.

Cheers!
