<p>You can read about my professional life and experience on my
<a href="https://www.mooreanalysis.com/" target="_blank">professional portfolio.</a></p>

But who am I?

I like to be active. I love any excuse to stop what I'm doing and go outside.

I enjoy any form of exercise (mainly cycling, lifting, and running), reading, and classic films.

I love good coffee with good friends.

I am a growing privacy and open source advocate and I look forward to exploring
this more in the future.

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to head over to my contact
page and I'll get back with you as soon as I can.

Cheers!
