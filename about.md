I have a passion for people. While I have held several different positions, my favorite part of every job has been interacting with diverse groups of people and understanding how I can leverage my resources to help them achieve their goals. I have a growing passion for data analytics and am an advanced programmer in Python, SQL, and R. I have used both Tableau and Power BI for data visualization projects. I also have limited working experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Stata, and Ruby/Rails.

My personal interests include any form of exercise (mainly cycling, lifting, and running), reading,
and classic films.
