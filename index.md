# Welcome to my personal blog

This is a simple website that has been hand-built by me, Ryan Moore, using the Jekyll static site generator and [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org ).

My focus, as of now, will be to simply share my thoughts and anything else I find
interesting. Content will probably be a mix of personal stuff and hobbies, which
may or may not be tech-specific.

Please feel free to take a look around. If you're interested, you can find the source code for this site on [GitHub](https://github.com/RMoore35/jekyll-simple.css).

Kudos to [Kev Q](https://kevq.uk/how-to-build-jekyll-site-simple-css/) for the excellent
guide.
