The online version of that book you sign at weddings and bourgie friends' houses when
they have you over for dinner.

Leave an entry of your own and/or read the entries left by others.

* This form uses <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a> for form handling.
As of now, I will be manually reviewing and posting below the contact form.
I hope to update this in the future to an easier system.

  <li>Entry: This is amazing. I can't believe you managed to fit this into such a small footprint! I'm currently working on a c++ program that has to be under 3kb, and it's quite a challenge.</li>
