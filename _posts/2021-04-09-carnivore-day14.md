This is day 14 of my 30 days of the carnivore diet. You can start from the beginning [here](https://blog.mooreanalysis.com/carnivore/).

## Update - Day 14

Had a very long two days and didn't have much time to update the carnivore diet tracker :)

Things are going well, although after two weeks I can safely say I am over having meat every day.

As I've echoed before, I don't want to complain too much about this. The fact that I have food to put in my stomach is enough for me.

The bowel issues are getting a little better but still not good enough for my liking. I continue to try to take in more fat to help solve the issues but with not much luck. Oh well, only one more week to go.
