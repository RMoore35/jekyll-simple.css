After many weeks and months of making fun of friends on the carnivore, paleo, and keto diets, I figured I need to try at least one of them so I can have some first hand experience. I chose carnivore
because it is the newest and as a long-time meat-lover it just made sense.

**I am not a doctor. Anything you decide to implement from this blog post is your decision, and yours alone.

OK, I'm not going to endorse any products, websites, or specific ways of doing the carnivore diet. What I will do is commit to documenting my 30 days on the carnivore diet. I may not post every day but I'll try my best.

My first day on the diet was March 26th and I started at dinner. I am following a pretty simple meal plan that I found online. For the first week, cheese and butter is allowed, along with fish, pork, and chicken. After the first week, cheese and butter is gone, and over the last three weeks, fish, pork, and chicken are eliminated and replaced with more beef and organ meat.

First impression? Well, after two days, I don't have any diarrhea yet (which is widely reported to start after a few days and last up to two weeks) which is good. Honestly though, I feel kind of crappy. It probably doesn't help that I wasn't eating much meat before this (more on that in another post) and I'm sure it'll take my body a bit to adjust. I am trying to drink as much water as possible as that is supposed to be key.

Last note: this first week I am going to continue to use protein powder (2 grams net carbs) but planning on stopping that after one week.

I don't plan on changing my activity at all. I want to keep everything as close as possible. Also, as a reference point, I weighed in at 171 lbs on the morning of March 26th. I have never found weighing myself as that useful but I figured that would be a good benchmark.

Again, I really felt the need to do this so that I could speak to friends from a place of personal experience. I don't have any other reason. I don't want to treat this too much like an experiment but I am also really curious about what will happen to my body. The carnivore diet has crazy devotees and wild weight-loss/body composition stories so who knows what I'll see.

OK, that's it for today.

Cheers!
