 I mentioned a few days over on Fosstodon that I had several challenges in the works for November.

 While, one of them I certainly have the ability to accomplish since I started on November 1st. My other challenge, to write on this blog is going good. To quote one of my favorite comedians, "And when I say it's going good I mean 'AHHHHHHH!!'".

 I did not write a post on November 1st nor in any of the previous 6 days. That means I've now missed 7 days. But, the spirit of the challenge will live on in that I will try to post much more frequently this month.

 Life has been very hectic lately and to be honest, some days I just have to push through and not really feel like I'm getting anywhere. Trying to start your own company, working a full-time job, and trying to balance family and making new friends has been way more challenging than I anticipated.

 But that is life. Others have it way harder. And often that's the only thing that gets me through.

 On the tech side of things, I need to write a blog post about spinning up an old laptop and dual-booting Solus on my existing linux machine. I have both ready to go, just need to take a few hours and see what happens. Bluetooth and wifi will probably be issues, as long as I can get past booting :)

 Well, that's it for today. Cheers.
