This is day 5 of my 30 days of the carnivore diet. You can start from the beginning [here](https://blog.mooreanalysis.com/carnivore/).

## Update - Day 5

Most important update: finally got rid of some waste out the other end.

Other than that, things are going well. Very low energy today but I read that is to be expected as you start the diet. No worries here just need to get through it.
