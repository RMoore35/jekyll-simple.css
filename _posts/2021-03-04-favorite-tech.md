I used to get a ton of use out of one particular piece of tech. It's sleek, waterproof, portable, and pretty cheap.

This little keyboard is seriously fun to use. It doesn't provide the level of joy that a mechanical keyboard does (which I've only used once, but is high on my priority list once I get my home office set up), but it works. And well, at that.

So what do I use it for?

Well, to be honest, I now only use it for random writing. Occasionally I will go to a coffee shop and I don't feel like taking my laptop. So, on my way out the door, all I have to grab is my tablet (currently an iPad - Oh, the horror!) and my Keys to Go.

It's also perfect for a coffee shop because it's waterproof. Genius.

But, that sounds lame when I promised this thing that I use all the time!

So, the real use case for me was in my last job. I was in the car for over 3 hours ever day (1.5 hours each way) with about 2-3 hours of work on-site in-between. I actually enjoyed the work, but the frustrating part was getting back to the office and knowing I still had an hour or two of paperwork to do.

Keys to Go was a life-saver. All I had to bring was my iPad and the slim Keys to Go and I could cut that time nearly in half. It's hard to put in words how much of a quality of life improvement this was. But suffice it to say, it was.

OK, but seriously, I'm not trying to endorse this product; just trying to highlight a relatively cheap, easy piece of tech that I have gotten a lot of mileage out of.

It's still fun to use. Like I said, I now use it to write. I can turn off all notifications on my iPad, put on some music, and just write for a while.

I enjoy writing. It's one of the reasons I started this blog. And anything that encourages me to write more is a win in my book.

There is also something to be said for good old fashioned pencil and paper. But that is another post for another day.


**Note: when I bought this it was under $50. Not sure I would pay $70 for it...
