This is day 5 of 10 exploring some interesting questions. Feel free to start at the <a href="https://rmooreblog.netlify.app/question1/">beginning.</a>

<h2> Day 5: What would this look like if it were easy?</h2>

To be honest, I'm not sure of the scope of this question. Do they mean today? Do they mean my job/current projects? Life?

I'll try to address each one at least a little bit.

For today, it would be easy if I weren't constantly battling with my own lazy nature all of the time. It would be so easy if I could just stay on task, have clear thoughts, and never get distracted. But we all know that's not life.

For my job/current projects, it would be easy if I found solutions quicker. I spend the most amount of time on my current projects looking things up, finding easier ways to do things, or just generally learning something new. Each class I have, each personal project I try, involves a lot of research. I need to find solutions and submit the best work I can. If I could find those solutions faster it would make the whole process smoother.

Finally, what would make life easier? I think some of the things above as well as a few new things. Questions like:

<ul>
  <li>What do I want to do for a career?</li>
  <li>Where should I live?</li>
  <li>How can I be better friend/person in general</li>
</ul>

All of those questions consume a lot of time and are always on my mind.

OK, now that I've addressed how I think things could be easier, it's important to say that I don't think I really want easy. I've learned so much in my short life so far from going through trials, going through hard times. I don't wish trials on anyone and I don't want to downplay the real struggles people have. Man, some people really struggle.

Personally, I just can't see myself learning any of the things I have without going through my own struggles and difficulties. So for me, I don't want easy.

Some people may say my life is easy. They are probably right. But everyone views their situation differently and I'm not here to judge.

Also, if life were easy I'm not sure that I would move forward. And that's something I want to do every day. Move forward - even if it's just one small step at a time.
