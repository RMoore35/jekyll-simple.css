This is day 3 of 10 exploring some interesting questions. Feel free to start at the <a href="https://blog.mooreanalysis.com/question1/">beginning.</a>

<h2> Day 3: What would I do to make today horrible? </h2>

I think this is a very simple question for me. I can make today horrible by not finished the one thing on my to-do list.

Before you judge me on only having one thing to do, read about my to-do list technique <a href="https://blog.mooreanalysis.com/goals/">here.</a>

I also want to recognize though that it doesn't have to be that simple. I think it is very easy to go through the day constantly judging ourselves for not being productive.

I will often sit around for 30 minutes to an hour in the morning and not do much of anything. This is my relaxation time. However, once I'm done with that time, I often feel like it is wasted. I have to quickly recognize those thoughts and consciously choose to move on. I will often take a walk
and then once I'm back I can get to it.

But even if that doesn't happen that doesn't have to be the end. I don't have to designate the whole day as a wasted day. I want to have the freedom and mental fortitude to intervene at any time, to recognize negative, unproductive thoughts I am having, and choose to make the rest of the day a win.

For me, this is often easier said than done. Again, some simple things can often get me out of this negative feedback loop:

<ul>
  <li>A walk or other light exercise</li>
  <li>A quick chat with a friend</li>
  <li>Journaling</li>
</ul>

If I do any of those things, I can often get back to a place of productivity and finish the day on a high note.

Rest is also key for my productivity. I have to recognize the night before that not getting the rest I need the night before will make tomorrow suck.

Give yourself some grace. We are in a tough time and we aren't going to make it better by constantly ragging on ourselves. I hope I can do the same and come out on the other side a better person.
