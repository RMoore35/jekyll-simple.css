I'm really close to the finish line of my [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) series and I was honestly running out of ideas. I have the last two days covered but today was a problem. Really, this will be a prequel of sorts to the next three days.

Since my late teenage years I have enjoyed prolonged periods of solitude. Interestingly, there is a limit or at least I imagine there is one. Anything over a few days my mind starts drifting too much and I have to reel myself back in. But up to a few days of silence can be very cathartic for me. Writing during those periods of solitude is even better.

I don't really do anything during these periods of time. I write some, read a book, drink coffee.

I'm fortunate that I have had jobs that always seem to provide the occasional two to three days off. I know not everyone is that lucky.

But it's always interesting to me to read about how different cultures handle silence and solitude. I want to visit these cultures, to not feel awkward walking around with someone and not saying anything.

It's also interesting to me that I tend to talk a lot when I get to know people. Outside my periods of solitude, I almost feel like I need to bring energy and activate something within whatever group I'm in, even though I'm a pretty extreme introvert.

Nevertheless, even when I'm around people, some of the most memorable experiences of my life have been those moments when I'm just sitting with a friend, drinking coffee, and not saying anything.

"Life never slows down."

Those words were uttered to me on a cold spring morning over a warm cup of coffee.

My hands were shaking. My head hurt. My heart was broken.

I will never forget those words. And I think that's why I like silence. Life never does slow down. But we can take those moments, however infrequent and short they may be, and stop.

Listen.

Don't move. Don't speak.

Just listen.
