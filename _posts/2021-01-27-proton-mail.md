As a fairly new user of <a href="https://protonmail.com/">Proton Mail</a>, I wanted
to do a quick review. I may expand this in the future to a part 2 but for now this
will be fairly short.

I have been increasingly interested in privacy and security online. This hasn't really been for any
particular reason, but rather I have just started paying attention to the amount of information
I was throwing out there and the ease at which it could be exploited.

At the same time, I have come to an understanding of the sheer size of information
I was offering up to google. I have multiple gmail accounts, used to use google as
my main search engine, and had a ton of history on youtube and google maps.

After reading some reviews on different privacy/security focused email solutions, I decided
to give Proton Mail a try. Interestingly, as I was doing this, I remembered at some
point in the past I created a Hushmail account.

The reason I bring up Hushmail is because at the time (around 15 years ago?) it was
nothing special. In fact, I remember the UX being absolutely horrendous. I can't comment
on the state of Hushmail now, but needless to say, after starting my Proton Mail account,
I am thoroughly impressed. The UX seems to be well laid out and I have had no struggles
navigating through.

I read that Proton Mail only offers 500 MB to free users so my first order of business
was making sure that would work. This may sound silly, but I honestly had no idea
how much 500 MB looks like in terms of email.

When I checked my gmail data, I was using 1.5 GB! But, I quickly learned that nearly
all of this was emailed photos I had saved for the last 10 years. This goes back
to how much information I was offering up to Google. There was no reason for those photos
to be there. I had already downloaded them, but they were just sitting in my email,
just waiting for the world to see.

I was able to fairly quickly get down well below 500 MB and I have now started the process of
slowly transitioning to Proton Mail. I am in the process of some password changes, so I
am just changing the email address of each account at the same time.

Long-term, I will probably keep gmail. In the professional world, gmail is very standard
and I will probably keep at least one account for that reason.

A few notable features:

<ul>
  <li>I set up 2FA right away</li>
  <li>I activated the "shortened email" feature, allowing me to receive at "pm.me"
  instead of the full "protonmail.com". Interestingly, a few accounts I tried to
  change wouldn't let me use the full email address, but when I switched to the "pm.me"
  everything worked fine.</li>
  <li>I opted for the highest encryption available for my encryption keys</li>
  <li>They do offer IMAP but I haven't messed around with it yet</li>
</ul>

I hope this review was useful. I'm excited to see what else Proton Mail has to offer.
