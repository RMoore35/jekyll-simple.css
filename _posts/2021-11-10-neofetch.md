This post outlines a very basic tool: neofetch. I have seen this tossed around via screenshot and comments numerous times on Fosstodon but haven't take the time to even download it - until now.

To download it, I justed used the software manager in Mint. I don't normally do that but hey, the GUI is there so why not use it?

There appears to be a ton of customization options. But for now, I am content with the basics. I really wanted to get it up and running, see what it does, and then tinker with it later, when I have time.

Here is what the default looks like for me:

It's really simple, gives a lot of info, and frankly, just looks cool. It also satisfies my nerd side and makes me feel like I belong just a little bit more :)

This was a really short post but I'm trying to get into some tech specific content. Cheers.
