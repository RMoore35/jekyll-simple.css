This is day 12 of my 30 days of the carnivore diet. You can start from the beginning [here](https://blog.mooreanalysis.com/carnivore/).

## Update - Day 12

Have had liver now for several days in a row. I enjoy it but it's hard when you are only eating meat. I've had liver before with other things but it's kinda difficult to get down on it's own. I have continued to try to add more fat to balance out my bowels but so far haven't had much success.

Cheers!
