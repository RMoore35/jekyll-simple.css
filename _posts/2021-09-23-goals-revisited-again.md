Recently I have had a few life changes, some positive and some negative. For me, that is always a good time to regroup and get some thoughts down. In fact, I think it is essential for my mental health.

As a quick reminder, I have a series of posts on goals and updates. They can be found at the end of this post.

The past few months have been strange but I've said that before. One of my goals for this year was to run a competitive 5k. Unfortunately, I had a foot injury fairly quickly after I set that goal and ended up not running for about 6 months. I finally got it checked this past week and am hoping for no fractures, although I need some resolution. In the meantime, the doc put me on some treatments that hopefully will heal it quickly if not fractured.

I also set a goal of reading 12 books in 12 months. I am happy to note that I am 8 books in and am about to finish my ninth so I am close to my goal. My pace of reading is picking up as I shift time away from other "hobbies".

I put hobbies in quotations because I'm spending a lot of time thinking about my numerous hobbies. I try to squeeze as much into my days as possible. I like staying busy and I enjoy doing a wide-range of things. But I am trying to be increasingly conscious of if I am wasting any time without becoming OCD about it. It bothers me when I have stated that I don't think gaming is a good use of time but I can't seem stop this endless cycle of binge-purge. I download a game or emulator, binge it for hours a day for about a week, only to delete it in frustration.

This is really about moderation - something I have always been pretty bad at. One thing I'm trying to do to help this is just some simple deep breathing and mindfulness activities. Without getting too touchy-feely, I have found that some deep breathing and pondering throughout the day really helps me get to where I want to be in terms of overall health.

I also had a pretty drastic life-happening this past week and now I'm trying to decide what to do with my extra time. For now, I want to devote much of it to reading and playing guitar. However, considering the purchase of a Raspberry Pi means I need to learn about that and see if that's something I want to do. It doesn't sound like it involves much tinkering time so it will probably happen soon.

I hope at least some of the above helps someone with their current life thoughts and/or struggles.
