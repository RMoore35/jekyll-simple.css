I wanted to do a quick run-down of the extensions I use in Visual Studio Code 2.
This will be far from an exhaustive guide both in terms of depth and breadth. I currently
have 27 extensions installed and I'm only going to go through a few of them.

Also, most of my work lately has been in R. I'll just leave that there...

OK, so first is Code Time. This used to be very important to me when I was working
as a developer, not so much anymore. Mostly, this is just a nice way to keep track
of what I've been doing and monitor my afk time accordingly :)

Second is indent-rainbow. This one took a little getting used to and it's definitely
not for everyone. Once I used it for a few days though, I was hooked. All this really does
is highlight each indent in one of four different colors, depending on the level of the
indent.

Third, and two I use together for full benefit, TODO Highlight and Todo Tree. These
are pretty self-explanatory, but essentially this just allows you to mark and automatically
highlight TODOs and FIXMEs, along with a few others.

Finally, I'll end on a collaborative note. I think this one may be contentious and there
may now be a better extension or tool, but when I last worked as a developer we used
Live Share. To be honest, this may not be the best note to end on, because we seemed
to have a lot of issues with it, from lag to finicky login/user problems.

OK, so one quick note to redeem myself: if you are working on a GitHub project, you need
to be using GitLens. I'll just let you look that up and leave it at that. But it is
amazing!
