A few weeks ago I commented on Fosstodon after having found Lynx browser and wanted to do a quick write-up of my impressions. This won't be a how-to. There are so many easy guides out there. I will give the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29) in case you have absolutely no idea what it is.

Being a text-based web browser, if you have never used Lynx it going to be very strange. Especially for someone like me, who has always used computers but has only recently become a "techie", Lynx is unlike anything I've ever used. And I've been browsing the web since the late 90s.

But, with that being said, if you've been around computers for long enough, you will instantly get a nostalgic feel. For me, Lynx is very fun to use, given that I go to the right sites. Some sites are simply not worth going to or don't work (Twitter, Facebook, flickr, etc.). Then again, at least two of those websites aren't worth going to period.

Lynx is somewhat customizeable but I haven't really messed around with that much. Mostly, I use it to read the news or to read wiki articles. I am far from using it as a daily driver which I imagine will make some hardcore Lynx users mad. Oh well.

I'll sign off with a fun fact: apparently as of 2020 Lynx is the oldest web browser still being maintained. So, if you need a nostalgic fix, get Lynx, mess around with it, and have fun!
