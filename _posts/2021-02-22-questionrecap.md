This is my recap of 10 days of exploring some interesting questions. Feel free to start at the <a href="https://rmooreblog.netlify.app/question1/">beginning.</a>

<h2> OK, so what the heck was that about?</h2>

Over the last ten blog entries, I have wrote on a variety of questions that I found posted on social media. I wasn't super intrigued by these questions at first, but I thought it might be a fun exercise to answer each question in turn and document the process.

I think the biggest take away for me is that my current job hunt is consuming a lot of my thoughts. This is both good and bad.

Obviously finding work is important. Really important. I would say on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the most important, finding a job would be a 10.

I know from my own experience thought that when something entirely consumes me, I don't handle it well. In this case, I want to work as hard as possible. I want to find a great job and embark on a great career.

But I still want to be able to sleep. I still want to enjoy time with friends.

I want to live a really balanced life. I want to constantly be making sure that I'm living a balanced life. I don't want to play too much but I also don't want to work too much. I want to spend as much time as possible with my family, including my extended family. I want to call anyone I can't see in-person frequently.

All of these things are important to me. And I think the way to make sure everything is staying in perspective is to have strong relationships and spend a lot of time in thought; to constantly evaluate my life.

So, these last 10 days of writing were very important for me. I hope to continue the habit of introspection and to do it often.
