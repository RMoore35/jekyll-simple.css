This is day 10 of 10 exploring some interesting questions. Feel free to start at the <a href="https://rmooreblog.netlify.app/question1/">beginning.</a>

<h2> Day 10: What would I do if it was impossible for me to fail?</h2>

I have always loved the thought of working for myself. I've never done it so I can't so for sure. Who knows? It may be miserable.

I have a few business ideas. It's funny because I am getting am MBA right now and if I were to take a weekend would probably be able to figure out the feasibility of at least one of them.

But regardless, this question is if I couldn't fail. I think in that sense, I would do it. I would start my own company and see where it goes.

I have also always thought it would be cool to be an independent programmer. Whether that means app development, starting my own consulting company, or something else, I don't know. But just to get to sit here and work on coding projects all day may be cool. (if you are currently doing this I would love to hear about it!)

Finally, something has always intrigued me about being in the FBI. Maybe I have just watched one too many movies. I even started an application to be an agent at one time. But the more I read the more I realized I didn't have the right background. Normally I would have pressed on. But the application process can take up to a year, so they say, and I wasn't that passionate about it. I didn't want to spend all that time and energy to get rejected for something that I don't think I am that interested in.

I think exercises like this are fun. These last ten blog entries, I have enjoyed exploring some thoughts and thinking about things a new way. I encourage anyone who has a blog, whatever the topic is, to explore some of the questions I did. If nothing else, it reminded me to spend more time in thought and to give yourself a break once in a while.
