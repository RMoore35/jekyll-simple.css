This will be the first post in a series of posts outlining my journey from index.html to a full-fledged website.

Obviously, there will be many steps in-between. I may not even finish it this year or this #100DaysToOffload cycle. But I want to stick with it.

** <b>Note:</b> <i>This will not be a continuous series. I will be posting content on this sporadically.</i>

So, what made me want to do this?

Well, I started this blog over a month now. I have really enjoyed it. I have little to no regrets.

But now that I've really gotten into it, I have realized how much I enjoy it. I want to keep deepening my knowledge and explore new areas.

I want to live a life well lived, one of continuous growth and lifelong learning.

What better way to do that than to build a website from scratch??

There are a few other things in my life that more specifically are leading me to do this and maybe I will share more about those in the future. But for now, let's dive right in.

One of the first resources I found was <i>HTML & CSS</i> by Jon Duckett. I chose not to purchase it, but I used a few of the code samples to get started. I honestly didn't know a few of the things that were just on the sample pages...

Here is a first look:

A few useful resources I've found so far:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.colorschemer.com/css-color-codes/" target="_blank">Color Picker</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools. Simple resource</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/" target="_blank">html/css cheat sheat</a></li>
</ul>

I look forward to keeping everyone updated on my progress.
