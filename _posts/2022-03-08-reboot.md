I knew if I didn't write today I probably would never write on this blog again.

I have taken nearly two months off of doing any writing and to be honest, life has been a little rough.

But life has been rough for a lot of people - and A LOT rougher than I have it.

Sometimes we just have to do that human thing and press on. Do what we need to do, try to enjoy each day, get a few fun projects done, and reach out if we need help.

As a brief update:

1. I quit one job and am about to start a new one. This is a good thing.

2. I am about to leave for a three day coffee roasting seminar, something I am very excited about. My own coffee roasting business is slowly starting to pick up and it will be exciting to see what the future holds.

3. I have been able to help a friend with some home improvement projects, something that brings me incredible joy. I once remodeled and sold a house of my own and I love that kind of work. There is something cathartic and very relaxing to me about doing even the home improvement tasks that are typically hated (sanding, painting edges, etc.)

That's where I'll leave it for today. It is my goal in the next few weeks or so to develop a new writing regimen. We'll see what form that takes.

Cheers.
