This is day 6 of 10 exploring some interesting questions. Feel free to start at the <a href="https://blog.mooreanalysis.com/question1/">beginning.</a>

<h2> Day 6: What if I did the opposite in every area?</h2>

This is an interesting thought exercise. I immediately jump to conclusions when thinking about this and assume that most areas of my life would get much better and a few would get way worse.

That's probably not entirely accurate. There are clearly things I could do better. Every day I make mistakes and I try to do a little better in those areas the next day.

One interesting exercise relating to this is laid out in Derek Sivers' book, <a href="https://sive.rs/n">"Hell Yeah or No".</a>

Disclosure: I own this book and am a big fan.

The idea is to basically say no to everything. In principle, you would then be free to do the things you want to do.

I don't agree with taking this to extremes. You could literally say no to everything and I'm not sure you would be better off for it. But personally, I have exercised this philosophy in several areas of my life and it has been beneficial.

So technically, if I said yes to all the things I have been saying no to recently, I'm pretty confident my life would be worse.

In other areas of my life though, the opposite may help. As I search for jobs, there is a lot I could do better and in fact may benefit from doing a 180 and pursuing it from a different angle.

As I near when I need to get a job, this is in fact what I intend to do. Starting this week I am going to be making a lot of changes in my job search strategy. I am excited about this and look forward to what the future holds.

For other parts of my life, I think I am doing OK. I want to really hone in on the areas where I was or am doing terrible and focus on those. Then, in the future, I can continue to work on other, less problematic areas.
