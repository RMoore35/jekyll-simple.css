This is day 6 of my 30 days of the carnivore diet. You can start from the beginning [here](https://blog.mooreanalysis.com/carnivore1/).

## Update - Day 6

Most notable improvement: much better energy today. I will have to closely monitor my progress going forward, as I am noticing increased "pudginess". Could be a by-product of maybe just getting into ketosis? Who knows. I'll keep close tabs and update as I progress.

Cheers!
