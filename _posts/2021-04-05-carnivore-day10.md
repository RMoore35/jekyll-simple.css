This is day 10 of my 30 days of the carnivore diet. You can start from the beginning [here](https://blog.mooreanalysis.com/carnivore/).

## Update - Day 10

OK, my bowels are still a little messed up today, but since I was a little whiny yesterday, I'm choosing to feel blessed today, because I am. Just the fact that I have the ability to try out weird diets like this is a blessing and I don't want to take it for granted.

It is possible that I am not getting enough fat in my diet so I guess I'll load up the skillet with even more butter tomorrow morning. Let's see if we can't finish these next three weeks strong :)

Cheers!
