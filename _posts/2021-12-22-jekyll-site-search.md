First off, huge shoutout to [KevQ](https://kevquirk.com/about/) and his excellent [guide](https://kevquirk.com/how-to-add-search-jekyll). While I didn't go the JavaScript route, I was able to achieve what he did without JavaScript. I just didn't want to include JavaScript as I didn't see any reason to. I'm sure I don't get anywhere near the traffic that he does and thus don't feel that I need the kind of polish and functionality he's going for.

So what did I do? Well, I added a way to [search my site](https://rmooreblog.netlify.app/search/)!

That probably doesn't sound very exciting to you but to me it is. Every little thing I get to accomplish in the tech world is very powerful to me.

All in all, I probably spent 15 minutes on this little project. But it's cool and I feel that it takes my site up a notch, even if it's a small notch.

Some things I have in the works on my site:

1. It's been a while since I reviewed the footprint. As of probably 5 months ago I was a member of the [512KB Green Team](https://512kb.club/) and I want to make sure that's still the case. I have no doubt I am but it would be good to see how much my site has grown since my initial induction.

2. On the size note, I need to learn about photo compression. I currently use a mix of PNG and JPEG files for my photos. I honestly know nothing about this.

3. My navigation menu is getting really long. I have a drop-down for part of the navigation menu on my other site and I don't really like it. I'm not sure what to do here. I'll have to research some ideas and see what I like best. Or just deal with it the way it is.

That's all. Thanks for reading.
