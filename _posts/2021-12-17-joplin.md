Have you heard of [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)?

If you haven't, that's OK. I've only known about it for a little over a month myself.

Since then, I've been using it daily. It was a bit of an adjustment at first - to get any sort of formatting you have to write in markdown which I wasn't used to doing on my phone.

But I've come to love it. It is not the most beautiful app I've ever used but it has all the features I need and is simple and clean.

I've used both evernote and Apple notes in the past but both have bothered me. Evernote because like nearly every tech company nowadays they started trying to do too much. And Apple notes because I accidently deleted both my local notes and the ones in iCloud, something that's surprisingly easy to do with Apple's "intuitive" operating system.

I have not tried syncing yet. But I've heard others have with success. As of right now I don't feel the need to sync across multiple devices because I'm trying to simplify my life anyway. Why have different notes on five different devices?

Anyway, that's my short write-up on Joplin. I really hope it is a long-term solution to my desire to stay organized and remember things :)

Cheers!
