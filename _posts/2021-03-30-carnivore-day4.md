This is day 4 of my 30 days of the carnivore diet. You can start from the beginning [here](https://blog.mooreanalysis.com/carnivore1/).

## Update - Day 4

Still cranking through this. Tried cooking pork belly for the first time yesterday and it was terrible. Not sure if I didn't cook it long enough but the fat just wasn't good. Might also just be a personal taste thing. Ended up cooking some extra bacon to make up for it.

I also did a 20 min run yesterday which really sucked. That could be due to low energy or the fact that I haven't run in about a week and a half due to some foot problems.

And, finally, the most exciting part, I've been constipated. Yay!

Until tomorrow.

Cheers!
