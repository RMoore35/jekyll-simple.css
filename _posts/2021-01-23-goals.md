I used to be very good at not only setting goals but achieving them. After I finished
my undergrad (now nearly 7 years ago), I slowly started drifting away from the habit.
As a result, I probably haven't accomplished as much in the last 7 years as I
would have liked to.

For me, the pandemic has highlighted a lot of areas that I want to improve and also
has given me a lot of time to think about some deep life questions.

I have never really set New Year's resolutions and that's not really what this post
is about. However, I do highly recommend you checking out this thoughtful post by
<a href="https://tim.blog/2018/12/28/past-year-review/">Tim Ferriss.</a>

I don't follow very much of what Tim says, but I have found this exercise helpful,
and not just around New Years.

But back to goals. A strategy I have found a lot of success with over the pandemic
has been to pick one thing (yes, just one) I want to accomplish each day and get
it done.

On its face, this sounds incredibly lazy. Just one thing?!

However, I have found this type of super-focused goal setting to be very powerful.
I'm sure everyone is different, but for me, once I accomplish that one thing, it
naturally snowballs into several other tasks and I end up finishing the day feeling
very accomplished.

Here is an example day:

  <ul><li>Goal: Buy materials I need for courses</li></ul>

And here is what I ended up doing:

<ul>
  <li>Grocery run</li>
  <li>Laundry (including bedding)</li>
  <li>Blog post</li>
  <li>Email to profs about missing class</li>
  <li>2 hours of personal coding time</li>
</ul>

Note that this doesn't happen every day. But more often than not, once I finish
what is often a very small initial task, I end up getting at least 2-3 more things
done. Normally, these are things I didn't even have on my mind.

As far as long term goals, I'm still working on those. I know some general things I
want to accomplish:

<ul>
  <li>Lose 20 pounds</li>
  <li>Find a job</li>
  <li>Run a competitive 5K</li>
</ul>

But I have yet to take more than initial action on those (other than the job search -
I've applied to a ton of jobs). I hope to get some time in the next few weeks to sit
down and really hash out a good strategy for accomplishing each of those.

I welcome suggestions on how I can get those things done!
