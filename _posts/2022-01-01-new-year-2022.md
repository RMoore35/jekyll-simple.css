Well, first of all, Happy New Year!

This is the time of year when a lot of people set New Year's resolutions. I tend not to. Turns out we are notoriously bad at following them so I figure why bother?

Last year was a bit of an anomoly for me. I knew I had to make some changes. I also had the entire month of December though to start shifting my mindset to accomplish some of those.

This year I didn't have that. I certainly have improvements I need to make in my life and so I'm writing a lot of those down and making a plan for how I'm going to turn those into lasting changes.

First, a retrospective.

As we all know, 2021 was yet another interesting year. There were definitely high and low points for me but all in all it was a good yINSERT LINK TO WHITE PAPERear. I won't elaborate on many of the things I did or accomplished because I've done that elsewhere already. I will just say this: one of the most joyous moments of my life happened this year. I moved closer to family and one day it just hit me that I didn't have to move anymore. I can live in the city I live in for the rest of my life and probably be very content with that. I will most definitely travel - maybe even do some long-term travel - but I can always come back here and be close to family. That makes me incredibly happy and I don't want to take it for granted.

A few things I would like to explore this year:

1. Playing more guitar. This is one of my favorite hobbies and I have been in maintenance mode for way too long. While it's good I've been able to play for 5-10 minutes every day, at this rate I'm not getting any better and likely never will. I think around 30 minutes every day is a solid start and close enough to my current pace that I'll be able to achieve it.

2. Helping get others involved in FOSS. One potential way to do that I introduced [here](https://rmooreblog.netlify.app/simple-blog-html-white-paper/). A few other ways I would like to start are getting people using Matrix to communicate and getting people to try Linux. I have yet to convince one person to do either one of those things.

3. Run again. Nearly this entire year I have had a nagging foot injury. I really don't care if I can ever run 5 miles again. But in it's current state, my foot even gets sore doing things like planks and push-ups. I had it checked out once in September - an x-ray revealed no issues - and then I didn't follow-up with the doctor to go see a specialist. Really, it's just because I hate doctors. Don't get me wrong, I think they are fine people, I just hate the whole process and can't stand it. Everything is so "clean" and "sterile" it just all feels fake and impersonal, two things I very much dislike.

Those are three things I'm thinking about how I can implement this year. I also have a few new friends I want to spend more time with. And let me tell you it can be awkward trying to build relationships as you get older. Things don't come naturally anymore.

Well, that's it. I sincerely hope you and yours had as good of a 2021 as you could have and I wish you an even better 2022.

Cheers!
