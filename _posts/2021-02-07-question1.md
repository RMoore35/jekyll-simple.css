This will mark day 1 of 10 where I will explore 10 questions I recently found to help
explore myself and my thoughts. The impetus to this was almost boiling frustration with
a few personal issues. I want to explore tech related topics in more detail but I feel this
an important step for me to take at this point. So here goes.

<h2> Day 1: How am I complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? </h2>

This is an interesting question for me. I previously wrote about some of my struggles over the
pandemic <a href="https://rmooreblog.netlify.app/covid/">here.</a>

To be clear, yes, the pandemic is an external thing, but I ultimately have control over my own situation. I chose to over-eat, to eat junk and not exercise, and to live a generally very unhealthy life. I have said over and over in my life, "I will live healthy. I will live healthy." But when the rubber met the road, I didn't act on that.

At the same time, I think it's important to give myself grace. The only way I have started to get out of the situation I was in, the conditions that I didn't want, was recognizing how deeply flawed I was
and recognizing that I have the will to get out of it.

It hasn't been easy. There have been a few nights where I've stayed up later than I should. Nothing good happens when you stay up too late. That's obviously a bit of an overstatement but in general, lack of sleep leads to other things for me: over-eating, over-drinking, and not exercising.

So what do I do? I let myself get 8 hours of sleep that night because I still think that's important. But the next day I am right back at it.

You can also look at this question the other way: "How am I complicit in creating the conditions I say I do want?" This is very helpful for me as well because it makes me create actionable steps to apply that will help me continue this journey.

This isn't easy. There is a reason so many people are hurting in this world. But if we can all take small steps each day with a long-term perspective of getting out of the situations we create, we will all be better for it.

Situations that we don't create? Do our best to shake them off and ask for help when we need it.
