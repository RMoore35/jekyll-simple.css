This is day 18 of my 30 days of the carnivore diet. You can start from the beginning [here](https://rmooreblog.netlify.app/carnivore/).

## Update - Day 18

Not going to lie, I am very excited to finish this diet. It has not been all that enjoyable both in terms of the lack of variety and how bad my stomach has felt. I have lost about 5 pounds during the almost three weeks I've been on it but that's a small enough amount it could all be water weight. Along those same lines, I do notice that I am a bit leaner.

I'll do a full wrap-up on the last day but wanted to get those thoughts down. Three more days.
