Well, here I am writing again from Manjaro. But this time, I'm writing from the Manjaro that is dual-booted on my HP laptop. I'm still writing in Ghostwriter and still enjoying it. I guess it has only been two days...

As I was thinking of what to write next and reflecting more on Ghostwriter I thought of an interesting work-flow idea. Why not write my posts in Manjaro and keep that side of my machine very bare bones (I've even thought about disabling WiFi - have to figure out how to do that)?

I also think this will give me the space to finally get back into creative writing.

Once upon a time I had a blog where I shared creative writings I had done. You may even be able to find it in an archive somewhere. I ended up not working on it anymore after I apparently scared some family members with my writing style. Let's just say mentally I was not as healthy as I am now although I still have a lot of work to do.

But, since I'm really enjoying writing posts using Ghostwriter and a bare-bones install seems to work well for me as well, why not give it another go?

Don't worry. I'll start creating tags or something or make a separate part of my blog for creative writing.

One thing I have noticed while writing the last two posts in Ghostwriter is that there is no spell-checking going on. When I try to select a dictionary for spell-check, there are no options. Interesting. I opened up ONLYOFFICE to check if spell-checking was happening there and it was. Guess I'll add that to the list of things to troubleshoot (including bluetooth - oof - which I discovered was no longer working while writing this post.

Oh well, I think keeping this install to a bare minimum will ultimately help my writing flow in the long run. Even if I just spend the time word-vomiting on Manjaro and then switch over to Mint to do my edits, that may help. Ultimately, with creative writing, I need several hours at a time and I think then the no distractions part of it will really pay off.

I remember hearing once about an author who had a laptop that only had Word or something on it. No internet, no browser, nothing else. It could be a myth or legend, I don't know. And it's not like I fancy myself a serious writer. But I think this will be an interesting solution. We'll see what happens with it.
