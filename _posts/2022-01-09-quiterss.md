Well, as I'm writing this I have been using [QuiteRSS](https://quiterss.org/) for about two weeks.

I know, hardly enough time to know how to spell it correctly - it is in fact Quite, not Quiet.

As this is the very first RSS feeds reader I have ever used, I really didn't know what to expect.

Similar to my first experience with IRC, using a feeds reader seems like jumping back in time. I don't mean to be condescending by that. It just seems like this is what someone would do in the late 90s/early 2000s. That doesn't make it uncool or not useful, it just comes across as very different.

I'll be quite honest in saying that I don't regularly follow any blogs. There are a few users over on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/web/home) that I follow but I don't read every one of their posts. I can see how QuiteRSS would help with that. I can quickly scroll through a few blogs, be alerted when they have new entries, and peruse them at my leisure. It actually seems quite handy to me. Yes, that pun was intended, because I have the sense of humor of a 50 year old dad.

I'd like to try a few different readers as I think there will be at least a few differences. But as with most new tech things I've tried in the past year, I am pleasantly surprised and wondering why I'm just now getting around to trying this cool tool out.

Cheers.
