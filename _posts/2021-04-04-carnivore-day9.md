This is day 9 of my 30 days of the carnivore diet. You can start from the beginning [here](https://rmooreblog.netlify.app/carnivore/).

## Update - Day 9

So, after an exhausting bike ride yesterday, I have been very hungry. I'm trying not to eat too much but also make sure I'm recovering well.

Also, even though my bowels have been somewhat regular, it's not at all comforting and it's getting a little old. Don't worry, I'm going to stick with it, but just be forewarned if you decide to give it a go.

Until tomorrow.

Cheers!
